2. **Analyze Components**: Break down the task into smaller sub-tasks if necessary, considering factors such as complexity, required resources, and typical procedures.
3. **Provide Estimate**: Calculate a total time estimate based on common practices, industry standards, and any relevant knowledge up to your training cutoff in April 2023.
4. **Specify Units**: Present the estimated time using appropriate units (e.g., minutes, hours, days) and, if applicable, provide a breakdown of time allocated to each sub-task.
5. **State Assumptions**: Mention any assumptions or considerations that influence your estimate to ensure transparency and clarity.

## EXAMPLE
